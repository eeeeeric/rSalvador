Experimental data of Crane, Thomas and Jones
}
\description{
A pair of fluctuation experiments conducted by Crane et al. (1996). For the first experiment,
Nt=3.6e9, and the second Nt=3.9e9. In both experiments, a 0.2 ml portion was plated from each
of the eleven 2.0-ml cultures. Thus, plating efficiency is e=0.1 in both experiments.
