\title{Computing MLE of m under the Luria-Delbruck model, accounting for variation in Nt
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
}
\description{
This function computes the MLE of m by accounting for the variation in 
Nt, the cell population size immediately prior to plating. Let
the final cell population sizes be Nt(1), Nt(2), ..., Nt(n). If the coefficient
of variation (CV) of Nt(1), ..., Nt(n) is large, an MLE of m can be computed by taking into
consideration of the CV for Nt. An underlying assumption is that each test tube has a different values of m,
i.e.,  m(1), m(2), ..., m(n), which are generated by a Gamma distribution with mean m0 and coefficient
of variation CV. The output of newton.B0 is an estimate of m0, computed using the Newton-Raphson
algorithm. The function name reflects the fact that a gamma mixture of the Luria-Delbruck distribution
is a B0 distribution (Zheng 2010). The specific algorithm is given in Zheng (2016), which is adapted
from an algorithm given in Zheng (2011).
