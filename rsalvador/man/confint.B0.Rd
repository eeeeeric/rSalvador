\title{
Likelihood ratio-based confidence interval for m, under the Luria-Delbruck model, 
accounting for variation in Nt
}
\description{
Nt is the (non-mutant) cell population size immediately prior to plating. In a fluctuation experiment 
comprising n tubes, the final cell population sizes are Nt(1), Nt(2), ..., Nt(n). If the coefficient
of variation (CV) of Nt(i) is large (greater than 0.1), an MLE of m can be computed by taking into
consideration of CV. An underlying assumption is that each test tube has a different values of m,
i.e.,  m(1), m(2), ..., m(n), which are generated by a Gamma distribution with mean m0 and coefficient
of variation CV. The output of confint.B0 is a likelihood-ratio based confidence interval for m0,
computed using the Newton-Raphson
algorithm. The function name reflects the fact that a gamma mixture of the Luria-Delbruck distribution
is a B0 distribution (Zheng 2010). The algorithm used is adapted from that given in Zheng (2011).
