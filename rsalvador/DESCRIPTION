Description: Like its predecessor SALVADOR, rSalvador is a software tool intended
 for experimentalists running fluctuation experiments in the laboratory, and for biology
 educators and students teaching or learning fluctuation assay in the classroom. rSalvador
 comprises R routines for inferring microbial mutation rates from fluctuation assay data.
 rSalvador can compute maximum likelihood estimates and likelihood ratio-based confidence
 intervals, adjusting for relative fitness, variation in final cell population size or plating
 efficiency. rSalvador can also be used to compare mutation rates using likelihood ratio
 tests. In addition to the usual continuous-time mutation model, rSalvador can accommodate
 Haldane's discrete-time mutation model. Furthermore, rSalvador can compute mutant cell
 distribution functions, plot log-likelihood functions, simulate fluctuation experiments and
 determine sample size.
