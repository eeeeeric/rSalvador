Description: R routines for inferring microbial mutation rates from fluctuation assay data.
  rSalvador can compute maximum likelihood estimates and likelihood ratio-based
  confidence intervals, adjusting for plating efficiency when necessary. rSalvador can also
  be used to compare mutation rates. In addition to the usual continuous-time Lea-Coulson
  mutation model, rSalvador can accommodate Haldane's discrete-time mutation model.
  Furthermore, rSalvador can compute mutant cell distribution functions, plot log-likelihood
  functions and simulate fluctuation experiments.
