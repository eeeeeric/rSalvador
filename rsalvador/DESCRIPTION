Description: Like its predecessor SALVADOR, rSalvador is a software tool intended
 for experimentalists running fluctuation experiments in the laboratory, and for biology
 educators and students teaching or learning fluctuation assay in the classroom.
 rSalvador comprises R routines for inferring microbial mutation rates from fluctuation
 assay data.  rSalvador can compute maximum likelihood estimates and likelihood ratio-based
  confidence intervals, adjusting for relative fitness or plating efficiency when necessary.
  rSalvador can also be used to compare mutation rates. In addition to the usual
  continuous-time Lea-Coulson mutation model, rSalvador can accommodate Haldane's discrete-time
  mutation model.  Furthermore, rSalvador can compute mutant cell distribution functions, plot
  log-likelihood functions and simulate fluctuation experiments.
