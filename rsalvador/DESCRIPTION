Depends: R (>= 2.15.0), hypergeo, gdata
Description: Routines for inferring microbial mutation rates from fluctuation assay
  data. rSalvador can compute maximum likelihood estimates and likelihood ratio-based
  confidence intervals, adjusting for plating efficiency when necessary. In addition
  to the more commonly used Lea-Coulson mutation model, rSalvador can accommodate
  Haldane's discrete-time mutation model. Furthermore, rSalvador can compute mutant
  cell distribution functions, plot log-likelihood functions and simulate fluctuation
  experiments.
